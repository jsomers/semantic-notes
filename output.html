<p>11:55 PM> Prospective memory may be defined as remembering to remember (Winograd, 1988) or remembering to perform an intended action. One difference between prospective and retrospective memory is that instead of recalling past actions, events, or knowledge, prospective memory is self-initiated and does not operate directly on external stimuli (Einstein & McDaniel, 2000, 2005)[citation needed]. Examples of prospective memory include remembering to take certain documents to the office, remembering to call someone at night, and remembering to take a medicine. Prospective memory consists of recalling an action or an intention triggered by either a stimulus or 'event' or a time.</p>

<p>[…]</p>

<p>A current debate is the extent to which prospective memory uses attentional resources to identify a cue (reminder). That is, prior to meeting the friend to whom you need to pass on the message, are any attentional resources devoted to maintaining this intention? The preparatory and attentional and memory process (PAM) theory (Smith, 2003; Smith & Bayen, 2004) argues that some resources are always necessary.

<p>A quick search with a few well chosen keywords is usually enough to turn a decaying memory of a half-forgotten article, scientific paper or news item into perfect recall of the information in question. Previously, these things at the penumbra of recollection could only be recovered with a great deal of effort or luck. The Internet has, in effect, upgraded my memory of such marginal items from haphazard and partial to reliable and total. This means I can swim freely through the Internet's vast oceans of information, safe in the knowledge that any connections between items that subsequently occur to me can still be made.

<p>12:46 AM> Chinese number words are remarkably brief. Most of them can be uttered in less than one-quarter of a second (for instance, 4 is 'si' and 7 'qi') Their English equivalents—"four," "seven"—are longer: pronouncing them takes about one-third of a second. The memory gap between English and Chinese apparently is entirely due to this difference in length. In languages as diverse as Welsh, Arabic, Chinese, English and Hebrew, there is a reproducible correlation between the time required to pronounce numbers in a given language and the memory span of its speakers. In this domain, the prize for efficacy goes to the Cantonese dialect of Chinese, whose brevity grants residents of Hong Kong a rocketing memory span of about 10 digits.

<p>11:00 AM> Anyway, a Macintosh had to switch individual bits in the memory chips on the video card, and it had to do it very fast, and in arbitrarily complicated patterns. Nowadays this is cheap and easy, but in the technological regime that prevailed in the early 1980s, the only realistic way to do it was to build the motherboard (which contained the CPU) and the video system (which contained the memory that was mapped onto the screen) as a tightly integrated whole–hence the single, hermetically sealed case that made the Macintosh so distinctive.

<p>A memristor is a pipe that changes diameter with the amount and   direction of water that flows through it. If water flows through this   pipe in one direction, it expands (becoming less resistive). But send   the water in the opposite direction and the pipe shrinks (becoming more   resistive). Further, the memristor remembers its diameter when water   last went through. Turn off the flow and the diameter of the pipe   ”freezes” until the water is turned back on. That freezing property  suits memristors brilliantly for computer memory.  The ability to  indefinitely store resistance values means that a  memristor can be used  as a nonvolatile memory.

This is one reason to be wary of, say, cholinergic memory enhancers: if they have no downsides, why doesn't the brain produce more acetylcholine already?

<p class="style111"><span class="style11">‘I, myself, alone, have more memories than all mankind since the world began’, he said to me. And also:’‘My dreams are like other people’s waking hours’. And again, toward dawn: ‘My memory, sir, is like a garbage heap.’— <em>Funes, el Memorioso</em>, Jorge Luis Borges</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="style11"><em>Funes, His Memory</em> tells the evocative tale of Ireneo Funes, a Uruguayan boy who suffers an accident which leaves him hopelessly immobilized along with an acute form of Hypermnesia — a mental abnormality expressed in exceptionally precise memory. So vivid is Funes’ memory that he can effortlessly distinguish any physical object at every distinct time of viewing. In his perpetual present images unfold their archaeology as infinite wells of detailed information: <em>“He knew the forms of the clouds in the southern sky on the morning of April 30th, 1882”. Funes’ </em>memories are intensely present as muscular and thermal sensations accompanying every visual record to have been recorded. He is able to reconstruct every event he had ever experienced. His recollections are so accurate that the time it takes to reconstruct an entire day’s worth of events equals to the duration of that very day. In Funes’ world perception makes no sense at all as there is simply no time or motive to perceive, reflect, or interpret.</p>

<p class="style11">As a consequence, Funes lacks the ability for detail suppression and any attempt to conceive of, or manage, his impressions — the very stuff of thought — is overridden with relentlessly literal recollections (<em>“We, in a glance, perceive three wine glasses on the table; Funes saw all the shoots, clusters, and grapes of the vine”.</em>) <em>Funes</em> is not able to generalize, to deduce or to induce anything he experiences. Things are just what they are, scaled one to one. Cursed with meticulous memory, Funes escapes to live in remoteness and isolation — a “dark room” — where new images do not enter and where his motionless figure is absorbed in the contemplation of a sprig of Artemisia.</p>

<p>Anyone who has used a spreadsheet has experience of functional
programming.  In a spreadsheet, one specifies the value of each cell
in terms of the values of other cells.  The focus is on <i>what</i> is
to be computed, not <i>how</i> it should be computed.  For
example:
</p>

<ul><li>we do not specify the order in which the cells should be calculated - instead we take it for granted that the spreadsheet will compute cells in an order which respects their dependencies.
</li><li>we do not tell the spreadsheet how to allocate its memory - rather, we expect it to present us with an apparently infinite plane of cells, and to allocate memory only to those cells which are actually in use.
</li><li>for the most part, we specify the value of a cell by an <i>expression</i> (whose parts can be evaluated in any order), rather than by a <i>sequence of commands </i> which computes its value.
</li></ul><p>An interesting consequence of the spreadsheet’s unspecified order
of re-calculation is that the notion of assignment is not very useful.
After all, if you don’t know exactly when an assignment will
happen, you can’t make much use of it!  This contrasts strongly
with programs in conventional languages like C, which consist
essentially of a carefully-specified sequence of assignments, or Java,
in which the ordering of method calls is crucial to the meaning of a
program. 
</p>

<p>This focus on the high-level “what” rather than the
low-level “how” is a distinguishing characteristic of
functional programming languages.</p>

<p>The first algorithm presented is the <em>Take the Best</em> algorithm, named because its policy is “take the best, ignore the rest”. In the first step, it invokes the <em>recognition principle</em>: if only one of two objects is recognized, it chooses the recognized object. If neither is recognized, it chooses randomly. If both are recognized, it moves on to the next discrimination step. For instance, if a person is asked which of city <em>a</em> and city <em>b</em> is bigger, and the person has never heard of <em>b</em>, they will pick <em>a</em>.</p>

<p>If both objects are recognized, the algorithm will next search its memory for useful information that might provide a cue regarding the correct answer. Suppose that you know a certain city has its own football team, while another doesn’t have one. It seems reasonable to assume that a city having a football team correlates with the city being of at least some minimum size, so the existence of a football team has positive cue value for predicting city size - it signals a higher value on the target variable.</p>

<p>In the second step, the Take the Best algorithm retrieves from memory the cue values of the highest ranking cue. If the cue <em>discriminates</em>, which is to say one object has a positive cue value and the other does not, the search is terminated and the object with the positive cue value is chosen. If the cue does not discriminate, the algorithm keeps searching for better cues, choosing randomly if no discriminating cue is found.

<p>Because it is sharable, your Broca’s area (or the part of it involved in selecting the words that you are going to speak) is being informed about the identity of what you are seeing, and you become able to name what you are seeing. At the same time,  your hippocampus is perhaps informed about what you have just seen,  so you can store this representation in memory.  Your parietal areas also become informed of what you have seen,  so they can orient attention, or decide that this is not something you want to attend to… and so on and so forth. The criterion of information sharing relates to the feeling that we have that, whenever a piece of information is conscious, we can do a very broad array of things with it. It is available.

<p>02:16 AM> Practical Aesthetics is based in the practice of breaking down a scene using a three step analysis that entails the following:</p>

<p>1) THE LITERAL: The essential and most basic description of what is taking place.</p>

<p>2) THE ESSENTIAL ACTION: An evocative and relevant description of what the character wants within the scene.</p>

<p>3) THE AS IF: The "as if" relates the "essential action" to the actors own life. for example: ESSENTIAL ACTION: To retrieve what is rightfully mine. AS IF: it's as if my girlfriend has taken away my favorite album that i was going to give as a gift. I need to retrieve it as it is mine. This step is a memory device. A spark to involve the actor in the scene. It helps the actor escape the fiction. Find the truth and apply it elsewhere.

<p>The philosophy behind our vision of thinking is that the crucial task of brains is, figuratively speaking, to “put their fingers on the essence of the situations facing them”, and that this is done by what we call “high-level perception”.  That means that we FARGonauts (as we, with deliberate humor, call ourselves) see a smooth continuum running from, at the lower end, the recognition of the color red, to the recognition of a red apple on a brown table, to the recognition of breakfast on a countertop, to the recognition of a mess in the back seat of our car, to the recognition of a mess in a friend’s romantic relationship, to the recognition of the vast web of implications of a friend’s potential divorce, to the recognition of the profound irony of the fact that the surgeon is now dying of the very disease that she herself cured so many times in her life, and so forth and so on.  Needless to say, the latter examples get closer and closer to the “high end” of the spectrum of high-level perception.</p>

<p>Our belief is that this kind of “seeing” (which obviously transcends any traditional “sensory modality”, such as vision or hearing or touch) is the core of human thought, and that it is carried out by the mechanisms of analogy-making.  We very deliberately avoid saying “analogical reasoning”, because to us that extremely standard, traditional expression is loaded with all sorts of unwanted and misleading connotations.  To us, the making of analogies means nothing more and nothing less than recognizing in something “before us” (not necessarily before our eyes, however) what it most centrally “is”.  This means making a link between two mental structures, one being the imperfect, crude representation that we have (so far) built up of this situation, and the other being a pre-stored mental representation of another situation from our past (or, just as often, if not much more often, a pre-stored mental representation of a bunch of situations from our past — which is to say, a known concept).  We FARGonauts do not draw any distinction between a memory of one event or situation, and a memory of a number of similar situations (i.e., a concept) — in fact, we see a memory of one event or situation as constituting every bit as much a genuine concept as is the blurry superposition of a hundred similar situations (which seems more like the traditional notion of what a concept is, although sometimes such a superposition is called a “schema”, a term that to our eyes muddies up the waters considerably).</p>

<p>In several experiments, we have contrasted directly what you can do subliminally and what you can only do consciously. Our results suggest that one very important difference is the time duration over which you can hold on to information. If information is subliminal, it enters the system, creates a temporary activation, but quickly dies out. It does so in the space of about one second, a little bit more perhaps depending on the experiments, but it dies out very fast  anyway. This finding also provides an answer for  people who think that subliminal images can be used in advertising, which is of course a gigantic myth. It’s not that subliminal images don’t have any impact, but their effect, in the very vast majority of experiments, is very short-lived. When you are conscious of  information, however, you can hold on to it essentially for as long as you wish,. It is now in your working memory, and is now meta-stable. The claim is that conscious information is reverberating in your brain, and this reverberating state includes a self-stabilizing loop that keeps the information stable over a long duration.

<p>04:21 PM> I start with Plato's critique of writing where he says that if we depend on writing, we will lose the ability to remember things. Our memory will become weak. And he also criticizes writing because the written text is not interactive in the way spoken communication is. He also says that written words are essentially shadows of the things they represent. They're not the thing itself. Of course we remember all this because Plato wrote it down — the ultimate irony.</p>

<p>We hear a thousand objections of this sort throughout history: Thoreau objecting to the telegraph, because even though it speeds things up, people won't have anything to say to one another. Then we have Samuel Morse, who invents the telegraph, objecting to the telephone because nothing important is ever going to be done over the telephone because there's no way to preserve or record a phone conversation. There were complaints about typewriters making writing too mechanical, too distant — it disconnects the author from the words. That a pen and pencil connects you more directly with the page. And then with the computer, you have the whole range of "this is going to revolutionize everything" versus "this is going to destroy everything."

<p>12:47 AM> Your average math class will have something like 8-10 problem sets in a semester. Compare that to 3 or 4 papers. The difference is critical because problem sets, like papers, force you to engage the material. You can skip tough sections in your textbook just fine <em>until a graded assignment</em>—then it's high time you read that shit carefully. Because even if you're really smart, there are certain technicalities that you'll need to pick up before you can solve a problem—definitions, theorems, or examples that you need to have in your working memory before the question can even make sense.</p>

<p>In English it's similar, in that papers keep you on point, except that (a) you have fewer than half of these things, and (b) a thesis in English can work without any specialized technical knowledge. It's conceivable that you could write a paper about X without learning anything other than the facts of X—no new concepts, definitions, etc. That is to say, you don't (necessarily) work on an English paper <em>in order to learn something</em>, which is almost always the case with Q assignments; what you do with an English paper, often, is play with ideas you already understand. In English you take your analytical toolbox and throw it <em>at</em> the book. In Math it goes the other way: you earn your toolbox <em>from</em> the book.

<p>02:47 AM> Yet even when one has finally brought oneself to accept — with protest — the necessity and inevitability of finitude, there is still something else to fear. A book can be read, and enjoyed, again and again. The prospect of a total loss of memory can only enhance one's sense of anticipation: every reading will be just like the first. But what if the first reading is also the last? My life resolves down to this, these experiences, these memories. My life is mine now, but one day it must inevitably become the possession of others. They can tell and retell the story, or what they know of it, but what is that to me? For my part, it seems that the stuff and substance of my life in all its colour, the value to me of all that I am and all that I have done, is reduced to dust by the fact that one day all this will be no more. That my life will continue to have meaning and value for others after I am gone is no consolation for such a loss. For whatever my life may be for others, it can never be this. Whatever meaning my life has for me, the person actually living it, as opposed to its significance for others as a source of enrichment or novelty in their lives, or after I am gone as an inspiring or amusing 'story', that meaning goes when I go, and nothing of this remains. — The condemned man casts a last, lingering look at his shabby possessions, grey walls, the rough furnishings of his cell, as if they were the most beautiful things he has ever seen. He sees something he did not see before: the beauty of all existence. But it is too late. In a few minutes, <em>this</em> beauty will be gone. That <em>this</em> will end is what I fear. People may or may not remember Geoffrey Klempner, and what I have done; but after <em>this</em> has gone it will be as if it had never existed. Yet it is here now, and will be taken away, no matter what I do. As I speak these words, the tape is running out. Memory grasps at experiences as they pass by, yet in the end must let everything go. — That is, no doubt, a very metaphysical fear. Many are not aware of it at all, until they are very close to death. For others, there are more immediate distractions; the agony of dying, bitter regret at a life wasted, or a fatigue that surrenders itself gladly into oblivion. That it is not felt by everyone at all times, however, makes the metaphysical fear of death no less real. Real it may be, but for all that, it is, I shall argue, illusory.

<p>In the 19th century, Europeans used to call Africa the Dark Continent. Today, as some cultures get amplified and distributed in accelerated ways, thanks to the (still largely-Anglo) Internet, parts of the world are going digitally dark. Russia among them. It isn’t about poor connectivity or infrastructure. It is about bits dying if they are not actively traded. Russia as an idea seems to be fading in the global consciousness far faster than you would expect. This isn’t just the normal rise and fall of empires. In the age of the Internet, there are only two continents: the main, harshly-floodlit continent, and the digital Dark Continent. The former is about the bit-churn at the forefront of the Real-Time Web. The latter is about forgotten empires, hard-to-find books, and young people furiously striving to make an American buck. Dying empires in centuries past used to live on, like spent supernovae, in what came after.  Graves were respected spaces. But the biases of the Internet interrupt that natural process of cultural reincarnation, and cause a more complete forgetting. If a memory isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. If a culture dies, tweets from the vigorous, living cultures flood the resulting global attention vacuum before any process of local regeneration can begin. Bits that aren’t constantly churning in the Real-Time Web are dead bits. Memories of Soviet Russia are dead bits. The dead-bit graves of the Internet are not respected spaces.

<p>11:48 PM>     *The real question is whether it is still normal for a schoolchild to live for years amid irrational terrors and lunatic misunderstandings. And here one is up against the very real difficulty of knowing what a child really feels and thinks. A child which appears reasonably happy may actually be suffering horrors which it cannot or will not reveal. It lives in a sort of alien under-world which we can only penetrate by memory or divination. Our chief clue is the fact that we were once children ourselves, and many people seem to forget the atmosphere of their own childhood entirely. Think for instance of the unnecessary torments that people will inflict by sending a child back to school with clothes of the wrong pattern, and refusing to see that this matters! Over things of this kind a child will sometimes utter a protest, but a great deal of the time its attitude is one of simple concealment. Not to expose your true feelings to an adult seems to be instinctive from the age of seven or eight upwards. Even the affection that one feels for a child, the desire to protect and cherish it, is a cause of misunderstanding. One can love a child, perhaps more deeply than one can love another adult, but it is rash to assume that the child feels any love in return. Looking back on my own childhood, after the infant years were over, I do not believe that I ever felt love for any mature person, except my mother, and even her I did not trust, in the sense that shyness made me conceal most of my real feelings from her. Love, the spontaneous, unqualified emotion of love was something I could only feel for people who were young.

<p><strong><span class="style111"><a href="/3rd_culture/bios/harriss.html">SAM HARRIS<br/></a></span></strong><span class="Bio"><em>Neuroscientist; Chairman, The Reason Project; Author, </em>Letter to a Christian Nation</span></p>

<p class="style111"><strong>THE UPLOAD HAS BEGUN</strong></p>

<p class="style111">It is now a staple of scientific fantasy, or nightmare, to envision that human minds will one day be uploaded onto a vast computer network like the Internet. While I am agnostic about whether we will ever break the neural code, allowing our inner lives to be read out as a series of bits, I notice that the prophesied upload is slowly occurring in my own case. For instance, the other day I recalled a famous passage from Adam Smith that I wanted to cite: something about an earthquake in China. I briefly considered scouring my shelves in search of my copy of<em> The Wealth of Nations</em>. But I have thousands of books spread throughout my house, and they are badly organized. I recently spent an hour looking for a title, and then another skimming its text, only to discover that it wasn’t the book I had wanted in the first place. And so it would have proved in the present case: for the passage I dimly remembered from Smith is to be found in <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>. Why not just type the words “adam smith china earthquake” into Google? Mission accomplished.</p>

<p class="style111">Of course, more or less everyone has come to depend on the Internet in this way. Increasingly, however, I rely on Google to recall my own thoughts. Being lazy, I am prone to cannibalizing my work: something said in a lecture will get plowed into an op-ed; the op-ed will later be absorbed into a book; snippets from the book may get spoken in another lecture. This process will occasionally leave me wondering just how and where and to what shameful extent I have plagiarized myself. Once again, the gates of memory swing not from my own medial temporal lobes but from a computer cluster far away, presumably where the rent is lower.</p>

<p class="style111">This migration to the Internet now includes my emotional life. For instance, I occasionally engage in public debates and panel discussions where I am pitted against some over-, under-, or mis-educated antagonist. “How did it go?” will be the question posed by wife or mother at the end of the day. I now know that I cannot answer this question unless I watch the debate online — for my memory of what happened is often at odds with the later impression I form based upon seeing the exchange. Which view is closer to reality? I have learned to trust the <em>YouTube </em>version. In any case, it is the only one that will endure.</p>

<p class="style111">Increasingly, I develop relationships with other scientists and writers that exist entirely online. Jerry Coyne and I just met for the first time in a taxi in Mexico. But this was after having traded hundreds of emails. Almost every sentence we have ever exchanged exists in my Sent Folder. Our entire relationship is, therefore, searchable. I have many other friends and mentors who exist for me in this way, primarily as email correspondents. This has changed my sense of community profoundly. There are people I have never met who have a better understanding of what I will be thinking tomorrow than some of my closest friends do.</p>

<p class="style111">And there are surprises to be had in reviewing this digital correspondence. I recently did a search of my Sent Folder for the phrase “Barack Obama” and discovered that someone wrote to me in 2004 to say that he intended to give a copy of my first book to his dear friend, Barack Obama. Why didn’t I remember this exchange? Because, at the time, I had no idea who Barack Obama was. Searching my bit stream, I am reminded not only of what I used to know, but of what I never properly understood.</p>

<p class="style111">I am by no means infatuated with computers. I do not belong to any social networking sites; I do not tweet (yet); and I do not post images to Flickr. But even in my case, an honest response to the Delphic admonition “know thyself” already requires an Internet search.</p>

<p>using the computer to augment human thought… this is the stuff we <em>should</em> be using these things for, but the software just isn't there yet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not only has it been shown by Huizinga, in his book Homo Ludens, that play is a fundamental religious activity; but also playing with any new technique is the first stage of handling the said technique seriously, of really exploiting it. Here, we have got genuine art creating new techniques? which will emerge as soon as more business executives who have on-line consoles in their offices, find it more fun to write poems on them than to explore the current state of the market, or to model their own firm's production flow. The computer can process more words, faster, than can any human being; it can multi-classify to an extent far beyond the ultimate limit of classification which man can contemplate: it can file-handle, mechanically generating any new file out of any old one with no constraint (e.g. it can turn all the men mentioned in a newspaper report into women, or turn an apologetic business letter into an abusive one, etc.). A moment's reflection should suffice to convince of the immensity of this power. Likewise, it can produce degrees and categories of randomness: and the philosophic re-examination of the whole notion of randomness has been one of the intellectual advances which have occurred partly as side-effects from the intensive study of mechanized calculation. But of all these techniques, the one which is most immediately relevant to compute poetry making, is that of man-machine interaction by means of a reactive online console connected to large rapid-access computer memory. For this enables the computer to enhance and extend the live poet's creativity; not to replace it as would batch-programming a poem on a computer. Larger vocabularies and unusual connexions between the words in them, together with intricate devices hitherto unexplored forms of word-combination, all these can be inserted into the machine, and still leave the live poet, operating the console, free to choose when, how and whether they should be employed: for the machine is being used here as an extension of a typewriter, not as an extension of a desk-calculator.</p>

<p>09:11 PM> My own armchair speculation is that it's likely that narratives of altruistic punishment and hunting go together in stories of the hunt. The archeological evidence shows that modern humans learned far better, more difficult, more cooperative techniques of hunting in the transition from the middle to the upper Paleolithic period. This transition occurs at the same time that we start producing totemic and anthropomorphic representations of animals — cave art, sculptures, and so on. Humans will sometimes be buried with animals in what appear to be religious rituals. Steven Mithen (1999) argues that sophisticated hunting, the so the sophisticated tool-making that makes it possible, sophisticated archives of cultural skill and cultural memory, the art that constitutes those archives, and the religion from which it may not differ, all explode at about the same time, as various earlier cognitive capacities become integrated with one another. I am particularly interested in his suggestion that one of the most important innovations of modern human hunters was that of anthropomorphizing animals: we could predict what they would do (and therefore hunt them better) when we began seeing the not as rocks or tones or trees but as near human in their habits, wiliness, motives, and so on. We ascribe intentions to them, for the first time, and keep track of them and their intentions. Totemic animals represent such anthropomorphisms, which led to religion (and no doubt to the punishing activities of angry gods), perhaps originally as a byproduct, perhaps as a mechanism for anthropomorphism. I would like to note the extent to which this would give rise to the idea of hunting as a kind of altruistic punishment as well. Humans go after predators — the tiger that has decimated a village, for example. But even when going after prey, our tendency is to treat the prey as culpable. Think of Melville's Ahab, or of Francoise, Proust's more domestic Ahab, cursing the chickens who try to escape her slaughter. Or think of the more-or-less ritually slaughtered bull, the villain whom the heroic matador will bring to heel. It seems likely that narratives of altruistic punishment are natural and easy generalizations of narratives of hunting, and conversely that narratives of hunting were in their way as exciting as anything since, because they are also narratives of altruistic punishment.

<p>From Chapter 1, "On Souls and Their Sizes":</p>

<p>One gloomy day in early 1991, a couple of months after my father died, I was standing in the kitchen of my parents' house, and my mother, looking at a sweet and touching photograph of my father taken perhaps fifteen years earlier, said to me, with a note of despair, "What meaning does that photograph have? None at all. It's just a flat piece of paper with dark spots on it here and there. It's useless." The bleakness of my mother's grief-drenched remark set my head spinning because I knew instinctively that I disagreed with her, but I didn't know how to express to her the way I felt the photograph should be considered.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of emotional pondering — soul searching, quite literally — I hit upon an analogy that I felt could convey to my mother my point of view, and which I hoped might lend her at least a tiny degree of consolation. What I said to her was along the following lines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the living room we have a book of the Chopin études for piano. All of its pages are just pieces of paper with dark marks on them, just as two dimensional and flat and foldable as the photograph of Dad — and yet, think of the powerful effect that they have had on people all over the world for 150 years now. Thanks to those black marks on those flat sheets of paper, untold thousands of people have collectively spent millions of hours moving their fingers over the keyboards of pianos in complicated patterns, producing sounds that give them indescribable pleasure and a sense of great meaning. Those pianists in turn have conveyed to many millions of listeners, including you and me, the profound emotions that churned in Frédéric Chopin's heart, thus affording all of us some partial access to Chopin's interiority — to the experience of living in the head, or rather the soul, of Frédéric Chopin. The marks on those sheets of paper are no less than soul-shards — scattered remnants of the shattered soul of Frédéric Chopin. Each of those strange geometries of notes has a unique power to bring back to life, inside our brains, some tiny fragment of the internal experiences of another human being — his sufferings, his joys, his deepest passions and tensions — and we thereby know, at least in part, what it was like to be that human being, and many people feel intense love for him. In just as potent a fashion, looking at that photograph of Dad brings back, to us who knew him intimately, the clearest memory of his smile and his gentleness, activates inside our living brains some of the most central representations of him that survive in us, makes little fragments of his soul dance again, but in the medium of brains other than his own. Like the score to a Chopin étude, that photograph is a soul-shard of someone departed, and it is something we should cherish as long as we live.</p>

<p><font size="5">B</font>IRDS are not the perfect flyers that you might expect. They cannot fly through
heavy rain. They get sucked up by thunderstorms, frozen by altitude, and burned
by lightning. They crash into obstacles, wander offshore, run out of fuel, and
die by the millions. They would rather not migrate in bad weather, and usually
don’t. Nonetheless, it now appears that Ocker and Crane may have been wrong:
there is evidence that some birds do occasionally fly inside clouds. This is
big news. Word of it appeared in 1972, in the proceedings of a NASA symposium
on animal navigation. Hidden among reports like “When the Beachhopper Looks at
the Moon” and “Anemomenotactic Orientation in Beetles and Scorpions” (that
is, “When a Bug Feels the Wind”) was a paper titled “Nocturnal Bird Migration
in Opaque Clouds.” It was written by Donald Griffin, the Harvard zoologist who
discovered the use of sonar by bats. Griffin reported that he had bought a
military surplus radar and on overcast nights in New York had tracked birds
that seemed to be flying inside clouds. There were only a few, and Griffin was
able to track them only for a couple of miles, but they appeared to be flying
straight. Griffin’s biggest problem was uncertainty over the flight conditions
at the birds’ altitude. Were the clouds really as thick as they looked from
below? Were the birds really flying blind? Griffin had good reason to believe
so, but as a scientist he had to be cautious. His final report, in 1973,
reinforced the earlier findings but was more cautiously titled “Oriented Bird
Migration in or Between Opaque Cloud Layers.” Ornithologists still cite it from
memory. To those interested in bird navigation, the difference between “in” and
“between” is just a detail; the point is, the birds seemed to know their way
without reference to the stars or to the ground. But to birds, whose first job
is keeping their wings level and controlling their turns, the distinction might
be crucial. Griffin, a former pilot, understands its importance. I recently
mentioned to him my impression that some ornithologists seem stuck on the
ground, and he laughed. “I keep telling them, ‘Gee, birds fly!’”<br/><br/></p>

<pre><code>Assuming they fly in the clouds, the question is how? Ornithologists have no
</code></pre>

<p>answer, and they shy away from speculation. It is known that birds navigate by
watching the ground and the positions of the sun, the moon, and the stars —
none of which would help them in clouds. But they may also use a host of
nonvisual clues, and may use mental “maps” based on sound, smell, air currents,
variations in gravitational pull, and other factors. Experiments have shown
that some species are extremely sensitive to magnetic forces. In their heads
they have magnetite crystals surrounded by nerves, which may give them
intuitive knowledge of their direction (and location) in the earth’s magnetic
field.<br/><br/></p>

<pre><code>Another possibility is that birds have internal gyroscopes of a primitive
</code></pre>

<p>sort. This is less farfetched than it seems: the rhythmic flapping of wings
could have the effect of Foucault’s pendulum, allowing a bird to sense turns
without any external cue. A pendulum is more than a hanging weight — it is a
hanging weight that has been pushed and is swinging freely. Swinging gives a
pendulum its special ability to maintain spatial orientation. Leon Foucault was
the French physicist who first used one, in 1851, to demonstrate the rotation
of the earth: though the pendulum appeared to change direction as it swung, in
fact the plane of its swing remained constant, and the apparent change was
caused by the turning of the earth underneath it. If birds rely on the pendulum
effect, they are not alone. Flies and mosquitoes (along with more than 85,000
other species of Diptera) use specially adapted vibrating rods to maintain
spatial orientation in flight. Not only can they turn sharply, roll upside
down, and land on the underside of leaves, but they can do it in fog. (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/langew/turn.htm">The Turn - 93.12</a>)

<p>Why are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? The
easy problems are easy precisely because they concern the explanation of
cognitive <i>abilities</i> and <i>functions</i>. To explain a cognitive
function, we need only specify a mechanism that can perform the function.
The methods of cognitive science are well-suited for this sort of explanation,
and so are well-suited to the easy problems of consciousness. By contrast,
the hard problem is hard precisely because it is not a problem about the
performance of functions. The problem persists even when the performance
of all the relevant functions is explained. (Here “function”
is not used in the narrow teleological sense of something that a system
is designed to do, but in the broader sense of any causal role in the production
of behavior that a system might perform.) </p>

<p>To explain reportability, for instance, is just to explain how a system
could perform the function of producing reports on internal states. To
explain internal access, we need to explain how a system could be appropriately
affected by its internal states and use information about those states
in directing later processes. To explain integration and control, we need
to explain how a system’s central processes can bring information contents
together and use them in the facilitation of various behaviors. These are
all problems about the explanation of functions. </p>

<p>How do we explain the performance of a function? By specifying a <i>mechanism</i>
that performs the function. Here, neurophysiological and cognitive modeling
are perfect for the task. If we want a detailed low-level explanation,
we can specify the neural mechanism that is responsible for the function.
If we want a more abstract explanation, we can specify a mechanism in computational
terms. Either way, a full and satisfying explanation will result. Once
we have specified the neural or computational mechanism that performs the
function of verbal report, for example, the bulk of our work in explaining
reportability is over. </p>

<p>In a way, the point is trivial. It is a <i>conceptual</i> fact about
these phenomena that their explanation only involves the explanation of
various functions, as the phenomena are <i>functionally definable</i>.
All it <i>means</i> for reportability to be instantiated in a system is
that the system has the capacity for verbal reports of internal information.
All it means for a system to be awake is for it to be appropriately receptive
to information from the environment and for it to be able to use this information
in directing behavior in an appropriate way. To see that this sort of thing
is a conceptual fact, note that someone who says “you have explained
the performance of the verbal report function, but you have not explained
reportability” is making a trivial conceptual mistake about reportability.
All it could <i>possibly</i> take to explain reportability is an explanation
of how the relevant function is performed; the same goes for the other
phenomena in question. </p>

<p>Throughout the higher-level sciences, reductive explanation works in
just this way. To explain the gene, for instance, we needed to specify
the mechanism that stores and transmits hereditary information from one
generation to the next. It turns out that DNA performs this function; once
we explain how the function is performed, we have explained the gene. To
explain life, we ultimately need to explain how a system can reproduce,
adapt to its environment, metabolize, and so on. All of these are questions
about the performance of functions, and so are well-suited to reductive
explanation. The same holds for most problems in cognitive science. To
explain learning, we need to explain the way in which a system’s behavioral
capacities are modified in light of environmental information, and the
way in which new information can be brought to bear in adapting a system’s
actions to its environment. If we show how a neural or computational mechanism
does the job, we have explained learning. We can say the same for other
cognitive phenomena, such as perception, memory, and language. Sometimes
the relevant functions need to be characterized quite subtly, but it is
clear that insofar as cognitive science explains these phenomena at all,
it does so by explaining the performance of functions. </p>

<p>When it comes to conscious experience, this sort of explanation fails.
What makes the hard problem hard and almost unique is that it goes <i>beyond</i>
problems about the performance of functions. To see this, note that even
when we have explained the performance of all the cognitive and behavioral
functions in the vicinity of experience - perceptual discrimination, categorization,
internal access, verbal report - there may still remain a further unanswered
question: <i>Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience?</i>
A simple explanation of the functions leaves this question open. </p>

<p>There is no analogous further question in the explanation of genes,
or of life, or of learning. If someone says “I can see that you have
explained how DNA stores and transmits hereditary information from one
generation to the next, but you have not explained how it is a <i>gene</i>”,
then they are making a conceptual mistake. All it means to be a gene is
to be an entity that performs the relevant storage and transmission function.
But if someone says “I can see that you have explained how information
is discriminated, integrated, and reported, but you have not explained
how it is <i>experienced</i>”, they are not making a conceptual mistake.
This is a nontrivial further question. </p>

<p>This further question is the key question in the problem of consciousness.
Why doesn’t all this information-processing go on “in the dark”,
free of any inner feel? Why is it that when electromagnetic waveforms impinge
on a retina and are discriminated and categorized by a visual system, this
discrimination and categorization is experienced as a sensation of vivid
red? We know that conscious experience <i>does</i> arise when these functions
are performed, but the very fact that it arises is the central mystery.
There is an <i>explanatory gap</i> (a term due to Levine 1983) between
the functions and experience, and we need an explanatory bridge to cross
it. A mere account of the functions stays on one side of the gap, so the
materials for the bridge must be found elsewhere. </p>

<h2>Notes on Cat's Cradle</h2>

<p>(13) Maybe I did hurt him, but I don't think I could have hurt him much. He was one of the best-protected human beings who ever lived.</p>

<p>(15) I can remember cold mornings when Frank, Father, and I would be all in a line in the front hall, and Angela would be bundling us up, treating us exactly the same. Only I was going to kindergarten; Frank was going to junior high; and Father was going to work on the atom bomb.</p>

<p>(33) A winded, defeated-looking fat woman in filthy coveralls trudged beside us, hearing what Miss Pefko said. She turned to examine Dr. Breed, looking at him with helpless reproach. She hated people who thought too much. At that moment, she struck me as an appropriate representative for almost all mankind.</p>

<p>(39) And, when I started to ask Dr. Breed questions about the day of the bomb, I found that the public-relations centers of my brain had been suffocated by booze and burning cat fur.</p>

<p>(40) "How small is Newt [the midget], by the way?"</p>

<p>"No bigger than an umbrella stand," said Dr. Breed, reading Newt's letter and frowning.</p>

<p>(45) [on <em>ice-nine</em>] And he helped me to see that the pattern of the bottom layer of cannonballs or of oranges determined how each subsequent layer would stack and lock.</p>

<p>(46) "Now suppose," chortled Dr. Breed, enjoying himself, …</p>

<p>(53) While I was talking to Dr. Breed in Ilium, Angela, Franklin, and Newton Hoenikker had in their possession seeds of <em>ice-nine</em>, seeds grown from their father's seed—-chips, in a manner of speaking, off the old block.</p>

<p>(63) As Bokonon says: "Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God."</p>

<p>(89) "Christ, back in Chicago, we don't make bicycles any more. It's all human relations now. The eggheads sit around trying to figure out new ways for everybody to be happy. Nobody can get fired, no matter what; and if somebody does accidentally make a bicycle, the union accuses us of cruel and inhuman practices and the government confiscates the bicycle for back taxes and gives it to a blind man in Afghanistan."</p>

<p>"And you think things will be better in San Lorenzo?"</p>

<p>"I know damn well they will be. The people down there are por enough and scared enough and ignorant enough to have some common sense!"</p>

<p>(121) She said that indexing was a thing that only the most amateurish author undertook to do for his own book. I asked her what she thought of Philip Castle's job.</p>

<p>"Flattering to the author, insulting to the reader," she said. "In a hyphenated word," she observed, with the shrewd amiability of an expert, '<em>self-indulgent</em>.' I'm always embarrassed when I see an index an author has made of his own work."</p>

<p>"Embarrassed?"</p>

<p>"It's a revealing thing, an author's index of his own work," she informed me. "It's a shameless exhibition—-to the <em>trained</em> eye."</p>

<p>"She can read character from an index," said her husband.</p>

<p>(158) We Bokonists believe that it is impossible to be sole-to-sole with another person without loving the person, provided the feet of both persons are clean and nicely tended.</p>

<p>(165) "Hello," he said to me, sleepily.</p>

<p>"Hello," I said. "I like your painting."</p>

<p>"You see what it is?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it means something different to everyone who sees it."</p>

<p>"It's a cat's cradle."</p>

<p>"Aha," I said. "Very good. The scratches are string. Right?"</p>

<p>"One of the oldest games there is, cat's cradle. Even the Eskimos know it."</p>

<p>"You don't say."</p>

<p>"For maybe a hundred thousand years or more, grownups have been waving tangles of string in their children's faces."</p>

<p>"Um."</p>

<p>Newt remained curled in the chair. He held out his painty hands as though a cat's cradle were strung between them. "No wonder kids grow up crazy. A cat's cradle is nothing but a bunch of X's between somebody's hands, and little kids look and look and look at all those X's…"</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"<em>No damn cat, and no damn cradle.</em>"</p>

<p>(169) "Oh," said Castle. "<em>Him</em>." He shrugged. "People have to talk about something just to keep their voice boxes in working order, so they'll have good voice boxes in case there's ever anything really meaningful to say."</p>

    Tiger got to hunt,
    Bird got to fly;
    Man got to sit and wonder, "Why, why, why?"
    Tiger got to sleep,
    Bird got to land,
    Man got to tell himself he understand.</p>

<p>(192) And we all vied, in saving face, to be the greatest student of human nature, the person with the quickest sense of humor.</p>

<p>(195) "There's no sense in beating around the bush," he said. "I'm a pretty good judge of character, if I do say so myself, and I like the cut of your jib."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>"I think you and I could really hit it off."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it."</p>

<p>"We've both got things that mesh."</p>

<p>I was grateful when he took his hand from my shoulder. He meshed the fingers of his hands like gear teeth. One hand represented him, I suppose, and the other represented me.</p>

<p>"We need each other." He wiggled his fingers to show me how gears worked.</p>

<p>I was silent for some time, though outwardly friendly.</p>

<p>(203) Her breasts were like pomegranates or what you will, but like nothing so much as a young woman's breasts.</p>

<p>Her feet were all but bare. Her toenails were exquisitely manicured. Her scanty sandals were gold.</p>

<p>"How—-how do you do?" I asked. My heart was pounding. Blood boiled in my ears.</p>

<p>"It is not possible to make a mistake," she assured me.</p>

<p>I did not know that this was a customary greeting given by all Bokononists when meeting a shy person.</p>

<p>(204) I am a man of the world, having had, by a reckoning I once made, more than fifty-three women. I can say that I have seen women undress themselves in every way that it can be done. I have watched the curtain part on every variation of the final act.</p>

<p>And yet, the one woman who made me groan involuntarily did no more than remove her sandals.</p>

<p>(209) "I suppose there was plenty of <em>boko-maruing</em> in those days."</p>

<p>(219) "I am a very bad scientist. I will do anything to make a human being feel better, even if it's unscientific. No scientist worthy of the name could say such a thing."</p>

<p>(246) In a messy world we were at least making our little corner clean.</p>

<p>(250) What happened to the dishrag that felt like a reticule, at any rate, was that Newt held it out to the dog, and the dog licked it. And the dog froze stiff.</p>

<p>(253) The rest of his speech was in American English. He had a written speech with him—-fustian and bombast, I imagine. But, when he found he was going to speak to so few, and to fellow Americans for the most part, he put the formal speech away.</p>

<p>A light sea wind ruffled his thining hair. "I am about to do a very un-ambassadorial thing," he declared. "I am about to tell you what I really feel."</p>

<p>Perhaps Minto had inhaled too much acetone, or perhaps he had an inkling of what was about to happen to everybody but me. At any rate, it was a strikingly Bokononist speech he gave.</p>

<p>"We are gathered here, friends," he said, "to honor <em>lo Hoon-yera Mora-toorz tut Zamoo-cratz-ya</em> [Hundred Martyrs to Democracy], children dead, all dead, all murdered in war. It is customary on days like this to call such lost children <em>men</em>. I am unable to call them men for this simple reason: that in the same war in which <em>lo Hoon-yera Mora-toorz tut Zamoo-cratz-ya</em> died, my own son died.</p>

<p>"My soul insists that I mourn not a man but a child.</p>

<p>"I do not say that children at war do not die like men, if they have to die. To their everlasting honor and our everlasting shame, they <em>do</em> die like men, thus making possible the manly jubilation of patriotic holidays.</p>

<p>"But they are murdered children all the same.</p>

<p>"And I propose to you that if we are to pay our sincere respects to the hundred lost children of San Lorenzo, that we might best spend the day despising what killed them; which is to say, the stupidity and viciousness of all mankind.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, when we remember wars, we should take off our clothes and paint ourselves blue and go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well-oiled guns.</p>

<p>"I do not mean to be ungrateful for the fine, martial show we are about to see—-and a thrilling show it really will be…"</p>

<p>He looked each of us in the eye, and then he commented very softly, throwing it away, "And hooray I say for thrilling shows."</p>

<p>We had to strain our ears to hear what Minton said next.</p>

<p>"But if today is really in honor of a hundred children murdered in war," he said, "is today a day for a thrilling show?</p>

<p>"The answer is yes, on one condition: that we, the celebrants, are working consciously and tirelessly to reduce the stupidity and viciousness of ourselves and of all mankind."</p>

<p>(263) Mona sat on one bed. I sat down on the other.</p>

<p>"I am about to say something that must have been said by men to women several times before," I informed her. "However, I don't believe that these words have ever carried quite the freight they carry now."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>I spread my hands. "Here we are."</p>

<p>(278) "'Many hands make much work light.' Old Chinese proverb."</p>

<p>"They were smart in a lot of ways, those Chinese were."</p>

<p>"Yes, let's keep their memory alive."</p>

<p>"I wish now I'd studied them more."</p>

<p>"Well, it was hard to do, even under ideal conditions."</p>

<p>(280) The experiment had solved in short order the mystery of how ants could survive in a waterless world. As far as I know, they were the only insects that did survive, and they did it by forming with their bodies tight balls around grains of <em>ice-nine</em>. They would generate enough heat at the center to kill half their number and produce one bead of dew. The dew was drinkable. The corpses were edible.</p>

<p>(281) "Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before," Bokonon tells us. "He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way."

<p>Excerpts from C.S. Lewis's <em>Mere Christianity</em>:</p>

<p>Now this objection is in one sense very right, very charitable, very spiritual, very sensitive. It has every available quality except that of being useful.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>These, then, are the two points I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>[http://jsomers.net/fear-trembling.html]</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Now the position would be quite hopeless but for this. There is one thing, and only one, in the whole universe which we know more about than we could learn from external observation. That one thing is Man. We do not merely observe men, we <em>are</em> men. In this case we have, so to speak, inside information; we are in the know. And because of that, we know that men find themselves under a moral law, which they did not make, and cannot quite forget even when they try, and which they know they ought to obey. Notice the following point. Anyone studying Man from the outside as we study electricity or cabbages, not knowing our language and consequently not able to get any inside knowledge from us, but merely observing what we did, would never get the slightest evidence that we had this moral law. How could he? for his observations would only show what we did, and the moral law is about what we ought to do. In the same way, if there were anything above or behind the observed facts in the case of stones or the weather, we, by studying them from outside, could never hope to discover it.</p>

<p>The position of the question, then, is like this. We want to know whether the universe simply happens to be what it is for no reason or whether there is a power behind it that makes it what it is. Since that power, if it exists, would be not one of the observed facts but a reality which makes them, no mere observation of the facts can find it. There is only one case in which we can know whether there is anything more, namely our own case. And in that one case we find there is. Or put it the other way round. If there was a controlling power outside the universe, it could not show itself to us as one of the facts inside the universe — no more than the architect of a house could actually be a wall or staircase or fireplace in that house. The only way in which we could expect it to show itself would be inside ourselves as an influence or a command trying to get us to behave in a certain way. And that is just what we do find inside ourselves. Surely this ought to arouse our suspicions? In the only case where you can expect to get an answer, the answer turns out to be Yes; and in the other cases, where you do not get an answer, you see why you do not. Suppose someone asked me, when I see a man in blue uniform going down the street leaving little paper packets at each house, why I suppose that they contain letters? I should reply, ‘Because whenever he leaves a similar little packet for me I find it does contain a letter.’ And if he then objected—‘But you’ve never seen all these letters which you think the other people are getting,; I should say, ‘Of course not, and I shouldn’t expect to, because they’re not addressed to me. I’m explaining the packets I’m not allowed to open by the ones I am allowed to open’ It is the same about this question. The only packet I am allowed to open is Man. When I do, especially when I open that particular man called Myself, I find that I do not exist on my own, that I am under a law; that somebody or something wants me to have in a certain way. I do not, of course , think that if I could get inside a stone or a tree I should find exactly the same thing, just as I do not think all the other people in the street get the same letters as I do. I should expect, for instance, to find that the stone had to obey the law of gravity — that whereas the sender of the letters merely tells me to obey the law of my human nature, he compels the stone to obey the laws of its stony nature. But I should expect to find that there was, so to speak, a sender of letters in both cases, a Power behind the facts, a Director, a Guide.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of <em>just</em> and <em>unjust</em>? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. what was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course I have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too — for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist — in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless — I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality — namely my idea of justice — was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. <em>Dark</em> would be a word without meaning.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Besides being complicated, reality, in my experience, is usually odd. It is not neat, not obvious, not what you expect. For instance, when you have grasped that the earth and the other planets all go round the sun, you would naturally expect that all the planets were made to match — all at equal distances from each other, say, or distances that regularly increased, or all the same size, or else getting bigger or smaller as you go further from the sun. In fact, you find no rhyme or reason (that we can see) about either the sizes or the distances; and some of them have one moon, one has four, one has two, some have none, and one has a ring.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>What is the problem? A universe that contains much that is obviously bad and apparently meaningless, but containing creatures like ourselves who know that it is bad and meaningless. There are only two views that face all the facts. one is the Christian view that this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been. The other is the view called dualism. Dualism means the belief that there are two equal and independent powers that the back of everything, one of them good and the other bad, and that this universe is the battlefield in which they fight out an endless war. I personally think that next to Christianity Dualism is the manliest and most sensible creed on the market. But it has a catch in it.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>But the moment you say that, you are putting into the universe a third thing in addition to the two Powers: some law or standard or rule of good which one of the powers conforms to and the other fails to conform to. But since the two powers are judged by this standard, then this standard, or the Being who made this standard, is farther back and higher up than either of them, and He will be the real God. In fact, what we meant by calling them good and bad turns out to be that one of them is in a right relation to the real ultimate God and the other in a wrong relation to Him.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong; I cannot. If a thing is free to be good it is also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Whey, then, did god give them free will? Because free will, thought it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata — of creatures that worked like machines — would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for his higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they must be free.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>One part of the claim tends to slip past us unnoticed because we have heard it so often that we no longer see what it amounts to. I mea the claim to forgive sins: any sins. Now unless the speaker is God, this is really so preposterous as to be comic. We can all understand how a man forgives offences against himself. You tread on my toes and I forgive you, you steal my money and I forgive you. But what should we make of a man, himself unrobbed and untrodden on, who announced that he forgave you for treading on other men’s toes and stealing other men’s money? Asinine fatuity is the kindest description we should give of his conduct. Yet this is what Jesus did. He told people that their sins were forgiven, and never waited to consult all the other people whom their sins had undoubtedly injured. He unhesitatingly behaved as if He was the party chiefly concerned, the person chiefly offended in all offences. This makes sense only if He really was the God whose laws are broken and whose love is wounded in every sin. In the mouth of any speaker who is not God, these words would imply what I can only regard as a silliness and conceit unrivalled by any other character in history.</p>

<p>Yet (and this is the strange, significant thing) even His enemies, when they read the Gospels, do not usually get the impression of silliness and conceit. Still less do unprejudiced readers. Christ says that He is ‘humble and meek’ and we believe Him; not noticing that, if He were merely a man, humility and meekness are the very last characteristics we could attribute to some of His sayings.</p>

<p>I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept His claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>We are told that Christ was killed for us, that His death has washed out our sins, and that by dying He disabled death itself. That is the formula. That is Christianity. That is what has to be believed.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Now repentance is no fun at all. It is something much harder than merely eating humble pie. It means unlearning all the self-conceit and self-will that we have been training ourselves into for thousands of years. It means killing part of yourself, undergoing a kind of death.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>The perfect submission, the perfect suffering, the perfect death were no only easier to Jesus because He was God, but were possible only because He was God. but surely that is a very odd reason for not accepting them? The teacher is able to form the letters for the child because the teacher is grown-up and knows how to write. That, of course, makes it easier for the teacher; and only because it is easier for him can he help the child. If it rejected him because it’s easy for grown-ups; and waited to learn writing from another child who could not write itself (and so had no ‘unfair’ advantage), it would not get on very quickly.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>A live body is not one that never gets hurt, but one that can to some extent repair itself. In the same way a Christian is not a man who never goes wrong, but a man who is enabled to repent and pick himself up and being over again after each stumble—-because the Christ-life is inside him, repairing him all the time, enabling him to repeat (in some degree) the kind of voluntary death which Christ Himself carried out.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>But the Christian thinks any good he does comes from the Christ-life inside him. he does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us; just as the roof of a greenhouse does not attract the sun because it is bright, but becomes bright because the sun shines on it.</p>

<p>And let me make it quite clear that when Christians say the Chris-life is in them, they do not mean simply something mental or moral. When they speak of being ‘in Christ’ or of Christ being ‘in them’, this is not simply a way of saying that they are thinking about Christ or copying Him. They mean that Christ is actually operating through them; that the whole mass of Christians are the physical organism through which Christ acts — that we are His fingers and muscles, the cells of his body. And perhaps that explains one or two things. It explains why this new life is spread not only by purely mental acts like belief, but by bodily acts like baptism and Holy Communion. It is not merely the spreading of an idea; it is more like evolution—-a biological or superbiological fact. There is no good trying to be more spiritual than God. God never meant man to be a purely spiritual creature. That is why He uses material things like bread and wine to put the new life into us. We may think this rather crude and unspiritual. God does not: He invented eating. He likes matter. He invented it.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Another possible objection is this. Why is God landing in this enemy-occupied world in disguise and starting a sort of secret society to undermine the devil? Why is He not landing in force, invading it? Is it that He is not strong enough? Well, Christians think He is going to land in force; we do not know when. But we can guess why He is delaying. He wants to give us the chance of joining His side freely. I do not suppose you and I would have thought much of a Frenchman who waited till the Allies were marching into Germany and then announced he was on our side. God will invade. But I wonder whether people who ask God to interfere openly and directly in our world quite realize what it will be like when He does. When that happens, it is the end of the world. When the author walks on to the stage the play is over. God is going to invade, all right: but what is the good of saying you are on His side then, when you see the whole natural universe melting away like a dream and something else — something it never entered your head to conceive — comes crashing in; something so beautiful to some of us and so terrible to others that none of us will have any choice left? For this time it will be God without disguise; something so overwhelming that it will strike either irresistible love or irresistible horror into every creature. It will be too late then to choose your side. There is no use saying you choose to lie down when it has become impossible to stand up. That will not be the time for choosing: it will be the time when we discover which side we really have chosen, whether we realized it before or not. Now, today, this moment, is our chance to choose the right side. God is holding back to give us that chance. It will not last for ever. We must take it or leave it.
