<p>obviously one should balance</p>

<p>but like…</p>

<p>what's the point of math?</p>

<p>i think that's an important question here</p>

<p>it's going to be modeling and abstracting</p>

<p>so in a sense you want to teach kids how to break problems into routines</p>

<p>but maybe they should have more practice doing that too</p>

<p>i agree</p>

<p>but like.. i just didn't dig the real-life videos/extraneous information stuff</p>

<p>i thought that was actually bad</p>

<p>me:  yeah, but you can have the one without the other</p>

<p>i'm with you on the real-world stuff, i think it's unnecessary, but then again i haven't taught a class full of 14 year-olds… maybe they need their attention grabbed with videos and shit</p>

<p>Sharon:  those kids are weak and should be disposed of</p>

<p>no need to string them along by tricking them</p>

<p>eigth grade math: neat! math is about buckets and shit!</p>

<p>03:14 AM> [Martin Gardner:] The university had what they called the "New Plan", and everybody had to take survey courses, and one of them was called Physical Science, and you had to take that. That was the closest I came to taking a science course, aside from a geology class that I audited. But I didn't take any math. My knowledge of math is at a very low level. I go up to calculus, and beyond that I don't understand any of the papers that are being written. I consider that that was an advantage for the type of column I was doing for <em>Scientific American</em>, because I had to understand what I was writing about, and that enabled me to write in such a way that an average reader could understand what I was saying. If you are writing popularly about math, I think it's good not to know too much math.

<p><em>“Right. I don’t believe in the idea that there are a few peculiar people capable of understanding math, and the rest of the world is normal. Math is a human discovery, and it’s no more complicated than humans can understand. I had a calculus book once that said, ‘What one fool can do, another can.’ What we’ve been able to work out about nature may look abstract and threatening to someone who hasn’t studied it, but it was fools who did it, and in the next generation, all the fools will understand it. There’s a tendency to pomposity in all this, to make it deep and profound.”</em>

<p>Moreover, as the psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons show in their new book “The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us,” the effects of experience are highly specific to the experiences themselves. If you train people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn’t make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t make you more logical, brain-training games don’t make you smarter. Accomplished people don’t bulk up their brains with intellectual calisthenics; they immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read lots of novels, scientists read lots of science.

<p>Much of the progress in biology since the 1960s has consisted of trying to enforce a moratorium on anthropomorphizing evolution.  That was a major academic slap-fight, and I’m not sure that sanity would have won the day if not for the availability of crushing experimental evidence backed up by clear math.  Getting people to stop putting themselves in alien shoes is a long, hard, uphill slog.  I’ve been fighting that battle on AI for years

<p>08:38 AM> "Justice" is not the same kind of word as "circle." We know what a perfect circle should look like because math is unambiguous; we've all agreed to construct them in just one way.</p>

<p>We can make a rough round thing on some blackboard unequivocally more circular; we can asymptotically, monotonically approach perfection. The same is not true of justice, because justice has no essential form.</p>

<p>12:47 AM> The regularity of their number systems also means that Asian children can perform basic functions—like addition—far more easily. Ask an English seven-year-old to add thirty-seven plus twenty two, in her head, and she has to convert the words to numbers (37   22). Only then can she do the math: 2 plus 7 is nine and 30 and 20 is 50, which makes 59. Ask an Asian child to add three-tens-seven and two tens-two, and then the necessary equation is right there, embedded in the sentence. No number translation is necessary: It's five-tens nine.

<p>07:18 PM> My philosophy:</p>

<h2>Embodied mind theories</h2>

<p>Embodied mind theories hold that mathematical thought is a natural outgrowth of the human cognitive apparatus which finds itself in our physical universe. For example, the abstract concept of number springs from the experience of counting discrete objects. It is held that mathematics is not universal and does not exist in any real sense, other than in human brains. Humans construct, but do not discover, mathematics.</p>

<p>With this view, the physical universe can thus be seen as the ultimate foundation of mathematics: it guided the evolution of the brain and later determined which questions this brain would find worthy of investigation. However, the human mind has no special claim on reality or approaches to it built out of math. If such constructs as Euler's identity are true then they are true as a map of the human mind and cognition.</p>

<p>Embodied mind theorists thus explain the effectiveness of mathematics — mathematics was constructed by the brain in order to be effective in this universe.</p>

<p>The most accessible, famous, and infamous treatment of this perspective is Where Mathematics Comes From, by George Lakoff and Rafael E. Núñez. In addition, mathematician Keith Devlin has investigated similar concepts with his book The Math Instinct. For more on the philosophical ideas that inspired this perspective, see cognitive science of mathematics.

<p>12:47 AM> Your average math class will have something like 8-10 problem sets in a semester. Compare that to 3 or 4 papers. The difference is critical because problem sets, like papers, force you to engage the material. You can skip tough sections in your textbook just fine <em>until a graded assignment</em>—then it's high time you read that shit carefully. Because even if you're really smart, there are certain technicalities that you'll need to pick up before you can solve a problem—definitions, theorems, or examples that you need to have in your working memory before the question can even make sense.</p>

<p>In English it's similar, in that papers keep you on point, except that (a) you have fewer than half of these things, and (b) a thesis in English can work without any specialized technical knowledge. It's conceivable that you could write a paper about X without learning anything other than the facts of X—no new concepts, definitions, etc. That is to say, you don't (necessarily) work on an English paper <em>in order to learn something</em>, which is almost always the case with Q assignments; what you do with an English paper, often, is play with ideas you already understand. In English you take your analytical toolbox and throw it <em>at</em> the book. In Math it goes the other way: you earn your toolbox <em>from</em> the book.

<p>(3) I don’t think anyone who’s in favor of “exploratory” math is <i>also</i> against drilling fundamentals. At least I’m not. I’m fairly convinced that to be actually good at anything requires a great deal of sustained deliberate practice, much of which will end up being fairly tedious. If you ask world-class violinists to name their least favorite activities, #1 will be “daily practice” and #2 will be “lessons with a coach.” (See the paper referenced at <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/deliberate-practice" class="ot-anchor" target="_blank">jsomers.net/blog/deliberate-practice</a>.)<br/><br/>The trick is to get kids to see the value of that tedium, and the way to do it, I think, is to give them really good problems to chew on, fast feedback about their progress, lots of incremental goals, and encouragement. They’ll end up <i>volunteering</i> for slog after slog.

<p>06:31 PM> My next linguistical suggestion is more rigorous. It is to fight the "if-this-guy-wants-to-talk-to-that-guy" syndrome: <em>never</em> refer to parts of programs or pieces of equipment in anthropomorphic terminology, nor allow your students to do so. …</p>

<p>The reason for this last suggestion is that the anthropomorphic metaphor — for whose introduction we can blame John von Neumann — is an enormous handicap for every computing community that has adopted it. …</p>

<p>It is misleading in the sense that it suggests that we can adequately cope with the unfamiliar discrete in terms of the familiar continuous, i.e. ourselves, quod non. It is paralyzing in the sense that, because persons exist and act <em>in time</em>, its adoption effectively prevents a departure from operational semantics and thus forces people to think about programs in terms of computational behaviors, based on an underlying computational model. <strong>This is bad, because operational reasoning is a tremendous waste of time.</strong></p>

<p>the fourier series and transform are some of the most amazing mathematical concepts.</p>

<p>Fourier series: you can express any periodic function using nothing more than a superposition of sine and cosine functions of varying wavelength and amplitude.</p>

<p>Fourier Transfrom: you can transform any function and find the amplitudes for each wavelength necessary to describe their superposition.</p>

<p>Example: if you measure the pressure as a function of time of the air by a piano while someone plays 3 notes simultaneously (a chord perhaps) you will get a seemingly “complex” waveform. Take the Fourier transform of that signal and you will get 3 spikes. The x location of each spike will tell you each of the 3 keys, and the amplitude of each spike will tell you how hard each key was pressed. It basically separates the information. Your brain does the same thing when you hear and see, which is why we can distinguish color and listen to one person in a noisy room.</p>

<p>I’ll take a stab at this.</p>

<p>Imagine that your matrix is a cube of Jello. Give it a poke with your finger (vector). When you poke it in some directions, the Jello will wobble this way and that, but if you poke it from a particular direction, it will move only in the direction—i.e., you’ve just pushed it away. That direction is like an eigenvector.</p>

<p>Another, similar, analogy comes to mind. Think of a very simple house of cards, with two vertical cards and one roof across the top. If you push it from the side, it kind of topples—that is, a simple push results in a shear transformation. But if you push it from the top down, the force is directly transmitted into the table, with no change in direction. That’s also like an eigenvector.</p>

<p>I don’t know if this is what you’re looking for, but this kind of thing is key to my view of mathematics… In day-to-day conversation, I’ll sometimes refer to something as an eigen____. While only loosely correct in some cases, I think using mathematical language this way has also made some much more advanced mathematical concepts much easier for me to understand.</p>

<p>That said, if I actually need to solve a problem <em>analytically</em>, I reach for a pencil and paper like anyone else.</p>

<p>But the question on the table is not, Are there biological sex differences? The question is, Why are there fewer women mathematicians and scientists? The patterns of bias that I described provide four interconnected answers to that question. First, and most obviously, biased perceptions produce discrimination: When a group of equally qualified men and women are evaluated for jobs, more of the men will get those jobs if they are perceived to be more qualified. Second, if people are rational, more men than women will put themselves forward into the academic competition, because men will see that they’ve got a better chance for success. Academic jobs will be more attractive to men because they face better odds, will get more resources, and so forth.</p>

<p>Third, biased perceptions earlier in life may well deter some female students from even attempting a career in science or mathematics. If your parents feel that you don’t have as much natural talent as someone else whose objective abilities are no better than yours, that may discourage you, as Eccles’s work shows. Finally, there’s likely to be a snowball effect. All of us have an easier time imagining ourselves in careers where there are other people like us. If the first three effects perpetuate a situation where there are few female scientists and mathematicians, young girls will be less likely to see math and science as a possible life.

<p>In New York, where Weingarten is a sought-after member of Democratic-campaign steering committees, state legislators and New York City Council members are even more closely tied to the U.F.T., which has the city’s largest political-action fund and contributes generously to Democrats and Republicans alike. As a result, in April of 2008 the State Legislature passed a law, promoted by the union, that prohibited Klein from using student test data to evaluate teachers for tenure, something that he had often talked about doing. </p>

<p>Scores should be used only “in a thoughtful and reflective way,” Weingarten told me. “We acted in Albany because no one trusted that Joel Klein would use them to measure performance in a fair way.”</p>

<p>Reformers like Cerf, Klein, Weisberg, and even Secretary Duncan often use the term “value-added scores” to refer to how they would quantify the teacher evaluation process. It is a phrase that sends chills down the spine of most teachers’-union officials. If, say, a student started the school year rated in the fortieth percentile in reading and the fiftieth percentile in math, and ended the year in the sixtieth percentile in both, then the teacher has “added value” that can be reduced to a number. “You take that, along with observation reports and other measures, and you really can rate a teacher,” Weisberg says. </p>

<p>In a speech in July to the National Education Association, a confederation of teachers’ unions, Duncan was booed when he mentioned student test data.</p>

<p class="style111">In mid-2009 I made a 7-day, round-the-world trip business trip, from Los Angeles, to Singapore, India, United Arab Emirates and Spain. It was a lecture tour — all work. As I landed in each of the countries I tried an experiment and Twittered my landing, asking if any friends were “in country”… My twitter was automatically posted to my Face Book. In each case, in each country, my inquiry was answered with a “hey, I happen to be in town as well, let’s meet for coffee…” Instant and very unexpected, gratification. Ask and you shall receive.</p>

<p class="style111">In a separate experiment, I was musing about the volume of gold that has been mined by human beings since the start of mining industry. I’m interested because I’m fascinated with idea of mining precious metals from Asteroids in the decades ahead. I had done some back of the envelope calculations that amazed me. I posted the following: </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="style111"> total gold ever mined on Earth is 161,000 tones. Equal to ~20 meters cubed… pls check my math!!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p class="style111">Within minutes I had 3 confirmations of the calculation as well as numbers for Platinum (~6 meters cubed), Rhodium (~3 m^3) and Palladium (~7 m^3). Ask and you shall receive. </p>

<p class="style111">How many times do I “wonder” about something and let it drop. I’m realizing that even complex questions can be answered (with enhancements!) with little more work than a digital prayer cast into the social-verse. The better and more intriguing my questions, the more compelling the answers I receive. Looking forward, I can imagine this holding true for requests of artwork, videos, manufactured goods and answers. The point is, that near instantaneous gratification is possible, and it’s the quality of the incentive that is most important. Incentive’s in this case being a chance encounter and an intriguing question… But in the future incentives being such things as cash, or who is asking the question, or the importance of the problem to be solved.</p>

<p>Jared is a bond trader. He is always telling me about interesting deals that he did. There’s this thing called an option, and there are puts, and calls, and the market steepens, so you put on steepeners, and it’s all very confusing, but the weird thing is that I know what all the words mean, I know exactly what a put is (the right, but not the responsibility, to sell something at a certain price) and in only three minutes I can figure out what should happen if you own a put and the market goes up, but I need the full three minutes to figure it out, and when he’s telling me a more complicated story, where the puts are just the first bit, there are lots of other bits to the story, I lose track very quickly, because I’m lost in thought (“let’s see, market goes up, that mean interest rates go down, and now, a put is the right to sell something…”) until he gets out the graph paper and starts walking me through it, and my eyes glazeth over and it’s very sad. Even though I understand all the little bits, I can’t understand them fast enough to get the big picture.</p>

<p>And the same thing happens in programming. If the basic concepts aren’t so easy that you don’t even have to think about them, you’re not going to get the big concepts.</p>

<p>Serge Lang, a math professor at Yale, used to give his Calculus students a fairly simple algebra problem on the first day of classes, one which almost everyone could solve, but some of them solved it as quickly as they could write while others took a while, and Professor Lang claimed that all of the students who solved the problem as quickly as they could write would get an A in the Calculus course, and all the others wouldn’t. The speed with which they solved a simple algebra problem was as good a predictor of the final grade in Calculus as a whole semester of homework, tests, midterms, and a final.
